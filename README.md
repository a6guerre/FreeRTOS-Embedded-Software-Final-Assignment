# FreeRTOS-Embedded-Software-Final-Assignment
Final Assignment for Embedded Real Time Operating Systems at UCSD Extension. This program is for a certificate in Embedded Software Engineering at UCSD. We used FreeRTOS running on a STM32L475G Microcontroller. 
This prject entails a full femonstration of FreeRTOS and its Key Features running on an STM32 microcontroller. These include, Tasks, Memory management, Software Timers, Interrupts, Queues, Task Synchronization, Mutexes and Event groups. This “metropolis” implements various tasks, all sharing one single processor, and how these tasks can work together, coordinate and share resources all in a manner that is free from corruption.
